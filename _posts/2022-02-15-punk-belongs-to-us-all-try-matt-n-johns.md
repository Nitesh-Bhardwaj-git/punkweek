> - "sartoshi you need an official discord" - no, we don't; mfers built one for mfers
> - "sartoshi you need to be in the discord as the leader" - no, i don't... mfers are leading their own ways (but im happy to get the word out about many mfer creations and ideas)
> - "sartoshi you need a roadmap" - no, mfers are paving their own roads
> - "sartoshi you should do paid promos" - no, mfers move organically
> - "sartoshi you need to send free mfers to this influencer or that celebrity" - no, those mfers are mfers just like us, mfer
> - "sartoshi we need to get more people to change their profile pic to mfers" - no, people will do it if they feel like it
> - "sartoshi nobody should sell mfers below a certain price" - no, mfers do what they want... we all mfers and they still mfers
> - "sartoshi what's the utility?" - mfers are the utility mfer... it's like a punk but you can build whatever you want with it
> - "sartoshi will the [minimum] floor [price] go up?" - i don't know mfer
> - "sartoshi my kid can draw that u suck i hate [non-fungible] tokens i hate u too” - lol cheers mfer
