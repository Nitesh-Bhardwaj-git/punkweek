Let's applaud Romero for bringing a fresh take on the V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, Classic vs Historic vs Antique vs Archaic saga.

[**Romero writes**](https://medium.com/@romeroeth/cryptopunks-are-not-v2-we-are-v2-c38d37410a20):

> Since we’re called V2, there’s some dual logic: some of the traits are original (gangsta) Matt & John's® CryptoPunk attributes, hand-drawn by me pixel-by-pixel from original ones (however, even in this case, some colors have been changed so that it does not look "old and already pretty tired").

> That part of the traits takes us back in time, keeping the punks original vibe, expressing respect for an already established historical look. However, the punks have been re-generated, so the combination of these traits is different: what new combination you can get with just the original traits? The second part of the traits is completely new that bring a fresh look and make everyone's favorite punks look renewed. For example, you can spot a punk with a black eye in left side and another punk with a laser beam out of his eyes. There are other fun traits that make punks look even cooler and funnier.

Wen roadmap?

> We'll be pioneers of something new. In general, as soon as we have a sold out, we will decide how to competently keep the course further.
But I definitely want this to be a community-driven project, and we’ll adopt best practices from the best [non-fungible] token projects to run it efficiently and profitably.


What's your take? Do you like the new punk look? Are you apeing in? [**Or are your waiting for V5?**](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoPunksDev/comments/sg80z1/alpha_alpha_alpha_new_mint_your_own_pixel_punks/)

Questions and comments welcome.

Yes, I am not a big influencer and not a famous person in crypto. With this project [- OctaCats -], I want to prove that even an ordinary person without enormous resources and costs can create a successful crypto project, adhering to a transparent and honest approach.
