title: "Crypto Bro Millionaire Influencer Case Study - Mike Hager - German Crypto Art Token 'Pope' And Bestselling Author of 'Getting Rich Quick w/ Non-Fungible Tokens - Everything You Need To Know' - Another Crypto Bro Scammer & Fraudster? - Inside the Bubble Propaganda Machine"
---



   Let's state the obvious that most "art" token need to get regulated as securities (why buy? obviously because the token is an investment and the buyer expects prices go up by HODLing - that is - doing nothing)
and the youtubers and influences promoting the "trash"  like todays's case study and crypto bro millionaire and fraudster Mr. Mike Hager  - calling himself in the cryptoverse "Nullinger" that I assume translates to know-nothing or dummy - can spout any non-sense without what looks like facing any consequences for defrauding thousand of newcomers with complete bullshit.

If you are German-speaking I am reading the fresh-off-the-press book titled "Getting Rich Quick with Non-Fungible Tokens - Everything You Need To Know" in German [**"Reich mit Non-Fungible Tokens - Alles, Was Du Wissen Musst" by Mike Hager**](https://www.m-vg.de/finanzbuchverlag/shop/article/22839-reich-mit-nfts/).   Mike "Nullinger" Hager who writes in the intro to have turned 300.000 Euro into 4.000.000 Euro (on paper) in about half a year (including buying and HODLing [**Matt & John's® Punk(ette) #1548**](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/1548) back in February 2021 for about 25.000 Euro).

The book is a bestseller¹ (paperback for Euro 15) - Are You Enjoying Staying Poor? -  and - surprise, surprise - pretty short on any critique or on how to draw / paint your own punks or on "the emperor has no clothes"  technicalities on how the "magic" money machine works or such. (Spoiler: It's a mix of ponzis, multi-level marketing pyramid schemes, and so on but - sure - that's material for a follow-up book).

Anyways, a classic - if you want to get-rich-quick sell a book about how-to get-rich-quick ;-) and endlessly promote your (online) mentoring classes / club that you can join (for $$$) to get inside tips.   But always remember Mr Mike Hager is NOT offering financial advice and never gamble more than you can loose - meaning the rich get richer and the poor get poorer - and so on.

What's your take?

PS:   See [**Mike "Nullinger" Hager's YouTube Channel - All About Having Fun Getting Rich (Quicker)**](https://www.youtube.com/c/MikeHagerGeld/videos). Quite an amazing collection of mostly irresponsible drivel (e.g. latest episode - Why is Heidi Klum buying and showing off a cryptopunk?²)  - even classics about warning about scams ;-) but than again tell me about your monkey .jpgs, ser?

Note ¹: In Germany, Austria & Switzerland. It's a Spiegel-Top 5 Bestseller (in Non-Fiction) - that's like a New York Times Besteller in the English world.  And yes, an english translations / version is in the works to be published starting in March 2022 (?).  But the crypto art pope in the English world is Gary "Vee" Vaynerchuk  and - of course - Mr Mike Hager is a nobody  (even making fun that with 3+ bored apes he is not on the public bored apes famous people list :-(. )

Note ²: Spoiler - Top-Model and Influencer Heide Klum got the punk gifted ("for free") in exchange for promoting another token collection etc. - welcome to the circuitous crypto fraudster circle.
