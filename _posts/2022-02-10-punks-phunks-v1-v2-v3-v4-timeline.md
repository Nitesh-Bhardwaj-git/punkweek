title: "Punks (and Phunks) V1, V2, V3, V4 Timeline / Version History - First (Quick) Draft - Comments and Corrections Welcome"
---


Inspired by a slide deck on the the punk v1 & v2 history making the rounds online (BUT with the download option turned-off! and cut-and-paste of text turned-off! too)
I present you a fresh take on the v1 & v2 saga with some light editing on the "original" text and timeline.

 See [**Punks (and Phunks) V1, V2, V3, V4 Timeline & Version History**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/awesome-cryptopunks-bubble/blob/master/PUNKS_TIMELINE.md). Note: Feel free to download (or fork) and cut-n-paste and (re)use any text snippets.

 Questions, comments and corrections more than welcome.
