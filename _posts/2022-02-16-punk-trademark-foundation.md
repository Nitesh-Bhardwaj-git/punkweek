title: "PUNK® Trademark Foundation (Or Is That DAO?) Upcoming - Let's Collect Funds to Defend That PUNK® Belongs To Us All - First Case - Crypto Fraudsters' Matt & John's® Ongoing Infringement for Serious Violation of the PUNK® Ethos / Philosophy / Trademark"

Here's an idea:

  Let's start a PUNK® Trademark Foundation (or is that DAO?) to defend the punk ethos / philosophy from  ongoing infringements for serious violations of the PUNK® ethos / philosophy.

> The punk ethos is primarily made up of beliefs such as non-conformity, anti-authoritarianism, anti-corporatism, a do-it-yourself ethic, anti-consumerist, anti-corporate greed, direct action and not "selling out".

Let's start with the Larva Lab (Crypto Bro Millionaire) Fraudsters' Matt & John's®. What's your take?
