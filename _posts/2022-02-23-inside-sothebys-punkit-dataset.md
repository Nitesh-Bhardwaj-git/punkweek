If anyone wants to analyze the 104 cheapo "sweep the floor in one transaction (tx)" punk lot now "rebranded" Punk It! at Sotheby's upcoming  truly historic [con-art fraud] auction
with a starting bid of US$ +14 million - I prepared a tabular datasets in the comma-separated values (.csv) format with all ids, (face & skin tone) types, and attributes.

  See [**sothebys/punkit.csv**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/cryptopunks/blob/master/sothebys/punkit.csv).

Tip: Structural racism? To get started count the dark (male 1, female 1)  punks and compare to the count of pale (male 3, female3) punks.

Any feminists? In the 104 cheapo punk lots count the male and female punks.  Note: In the "original" punk population the distribution is 60.39% male, 38.40% female and the rest is super-rare aliens, apes & zombies.

Questions and comments welcome.  Bonus for sharing your insight and analysis.
