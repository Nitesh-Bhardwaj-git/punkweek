Disclaimer:  Let's make it clear - I am not affiliated with the punk mother fuckers.
The punk mother fuckers are of course a scam, a rug pull and a cash grab all-at-once.
And the bullshit talk about the "soft pixel" unique style  about the "art" is ... bullshit, mother fucker.
Another crypto bro fraudster & millionaire making up bullshit selling nothing for fun & profit. Wen music stop?
