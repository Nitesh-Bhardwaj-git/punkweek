   I am trying to put together a free women pixies edition¹.  It looks like the "original" World of Women Pixies in the 1500x1500 format can get downsampled into a "pixier" 98x98 format (see above in 1x).

  What's your take? Are (women) pixies the new (women) punks?


PS: To paraphrase the Wow Pixies disclaimer - Free Women Pixies (98x98) are not associated with World of Women Pixies (Official).
