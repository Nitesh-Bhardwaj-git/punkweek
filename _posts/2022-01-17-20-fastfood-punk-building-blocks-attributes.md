For easy (re)use I added  20+ new free punk building blocks / attributes in the 24x24 format.  Let's welcome the first batch in the new [**Fast Food Series (24x24)**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/punks.blocks#fast-food-series-2424) incuding (baseball) caps for Br, Brk, Castle, Dom, Dunk, Hut, Jack, Kentucky, Mcd, Sub, W & more.

<!-- more -->

   Yes, you can. Look for the [**/fastfood**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/punks.blocks/tree/master/fastfood) directory for the free building block / attribute images in the 24x24 format to right-click and download.

  Questions and comments welcome.
