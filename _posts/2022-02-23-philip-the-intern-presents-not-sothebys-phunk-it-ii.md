 As a follow-up to [**Philip the Intern Presents: Not Sotheby's Phunk It! Truly Historic Free Download - 104 Phunks. 1 Lot. 4 Versions (V1/V2/V3/V4). 1 Bitmap. Right-Click & Save To Own 100% Forever - phunkit.png (~26k)**](2022-02-23-philip-the-intern-presents-not-sothebys-phunk-it-i.md) I put together a new script that generates all 104 punks form the punk it! lot from zero / scratch, that is, using the attributes from the [**punkit.csv dataset**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/cryptopunks/blob/master/sothebys/punkit.csv).

  Philip the Intern not only "hand-flips" all punks one-by-one but turns one lot into six.

  <!-- more -->

   The spec for the versions reads:

- No. 1 -  All Black "Dark" Phunks
- No. 2  - All White "Pale" Phunks
- No. 3  - All Zombies
- No. 4 - All Gold Phunks
- No. 5 - All Pink Phunks
- No. 6 - All Ghosts

Questions and comments welcome.

PS: Yes, you can. Generate your own originals that you own 100% forever, see the [**sothebys/generate_phunkit script**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/cryptopunks/blob/master/sothebys/generate_phunkit.rb) to get started.
