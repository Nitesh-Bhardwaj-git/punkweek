Note ¹:  At the beginning of August 2021, it was reported that a buyer purchase over 100 punks [V2]. According to the reports, the anonymous investor tried not the attract too much attention and used the decentralized block production protocol MiningDAO.

Therefore, he bride a miner to include all the punk purchases on a single ethereum block. The trade was well planned and calculated, as a community member reported. Previously, the anonymous buyer made a smaller purchase at the height of block #12924823, etherscan recorded.

Usually, to buy one of these [non-fungible] tokens, a user executes a "normal" ethereum transaction. The anonymous buyer tried to mitigate a reaction from the market. Thus, why they operated under the radar.

In total, the punks, some of the cheapest in the collection amounted to a staggering $7 million.
