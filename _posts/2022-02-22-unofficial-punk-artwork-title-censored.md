title: "Trash Artist and 'Unofficial Punk®' Eric Rhodes Reports OpenSea Censors 'PUNK®' in Titles of New Artwork! Welcome to the New 'Decentralized' Digital Market!"
---

Self-declared trash artist and "Unofficial Punk®"  (are there any official punks¹?) Eric Rhodes (also known as Second Realm)
writes on the one-year anniversary of the first "Unofficial Punks®" trash art collection:

> It's the 1-year anniversary of [my] "Unofficial Punks®" [trash art collection]. And I learned that my punk fam[ily trash art collection]  -  who don't have the blue checkmark -  can't use the word "PUNK" in titles when minting on the OpenSea shared store front. So I minted [**"Unofficial 'PUNK®'"**](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/107916259476164807250970753368899698568403674003143293495325882700104193802241) for them.

What's your take?  Who owns "PUNK®"? Or a "2×2 Red Pixel Clown Nose"?

> Anything that came after [and yes - before - hint: V1] Matt & John's® Punks V2 is a blatant rip off

PS:  Ironically Eric Rhodes (also known as Second Realm)  suffers from the same self-dilusion and hybris.  The [**"Unofficial Punks®" page**](https://www.unofficialpunks.com/) reads - I am not making this up:

> The award-winning artist, [Eric Rhodes also known as] Second Realm,
> ignited the alt-punks [art] movement and the [non-fungible] token avatar
> renaissance after he posted on an american microblog his hand-painted [or is that clicked?] punk [pixel art].

>>  I don't have a punk. So I made [or is that hand-painted?]
>>    my own Second Realm® [24×24 Pixel] Punk.

> Unofficial Punks® are the limited edition custom punks created by the founder Eric Rhodes. Certified Unofficial Punks® are all of the sub-genres and artists in the Punkverse who have joined Eric Rhodes on this social collaboration
in homage to the original gangsta Matt & John's® punks V2.

Note ¹: Punk philosophy is that you are what you are. Period. Fuck you. There are no "official" or "unofficial" punks and no "authentic" and "unauthentic" or "alt" punks.  A punk is a punk is a punk is a punk. Period. And yes, PUNK® belongs to us all.
