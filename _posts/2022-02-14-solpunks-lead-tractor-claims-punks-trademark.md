title: "SolPunks Lead ('Tractor') Claims SolPunks Trademark to Bully and Shutdown DumbSolPunks Parody - New Episode Coming Soon To A Blockchain Near You? V1, V2 & V3? Or Dumb, Dumber & Dumbest?"
---


While doing a search on github to find any open source punk code out there  (try yourself - [**#cryptopunks**](https://github.com/topics/cryptopunks)) I found - the [**SolPunks Truth Foundation / Project**](https://github.com/solpunks69/SolPunks-Truth-Project) and the Dumb SolPunks parody.

The now "archived" Dumb SolPunks website reads:

> WARNING: Dumb SolPunks are NOT for everybody.

  It looks like SolPunk Lead "Tractor" bullied with a (fake) claim of the SolPunks trademark the Ex-Facebooker "Chunke Monke" DumbSolPunks Lead  and shutdown the minting of the parody tokens.

> A crypto news report / story on punk tokens reads:
>
> Chunke Monke [head of DumbSolPunks]
> bemoans this aggressive culture among some punk projects.
>
>>"I've seen many punk [non-fungible] token discords. They are not fun. There's no love
>> or adoration for the art or the story because it's all hollow.
>> There's no meaning and no durable community."
>
> But, "Parody [non-fungible] token can retain a lot of value,
> maybe more than the original," if they have a certain sense of good humor, he says.


  Anyways, is the V1, V2, V3 Punks saga any different or even "dumber", that is, sillier and more exemplary tale of human greed and stupidity?  Is it a parody? Or a farce?

 What's your take?  Questions, comments and insider news welcome.
