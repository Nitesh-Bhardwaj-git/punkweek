title: "(Academic) Paper / Essay - Are CryptoPunks Copyrightable? (21 Pages) by Brian L. Frye, University of Kentucky - College of Law (Spoiler: Itâ€™s unclear. Translation: No, of course not.) - What's Your Take?"
---

Finally the first (academic) paper / essay trying to say in many (read between the lines) words the obvious  -  yes, the Lavra Labs Bros - Matt Hall and John Watkinson  - are con-art crypto bro fraudsters if the continue pushing the false narrative ("or is that self-enriching lies") with claiming copyright for trivial 24x24px (profile) images in 8-bit colors.

<!-- more -->

 Note: There might be a case for "protecting" the complete collection but individual attributes (a smile, for example, is a single black pixel in a 24x24 matrix, the clown nose, is four red pixels, the mouth is three black pixels, and so on)
or punks, that is, let's face it - ridiculous.

   Remember - the Larva Labs Bros - Matt Hall and John Watkinson
 - pulled in $80+ millions in a single day (May 3rd, 2021) for Meebits - 20 000 3D blocky voxel character (models) - yes, sold on-purpose overpriced in a dutch-auction -  they are rich beyond anyone's dream - and the keep pushing the false narrative with the cryptopunks that started as an experiment by formerly humble coders  - in early interviews on the Cryptopunks blockchain experiment asked if John Watkinson considers himself an "artist" -  John Watkinson said - of course not.

  Anyways, the [**Are CryptoPunks Copyrightable?**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4029323) paper abstract reads:

> Larva Labs's CryptoPunks [non-fungible] token are iconic.
> Created in 2017, they were among the first [non-fungible] tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Four years later, they are among the most valuable, selling for anywhere from $200,000 to millions of dollars.
>
> The CryptoPunks collection consists of 10,000 [non-fungible] tokens, each of which is associated with a unique CryptoPunks image. Everyone knows who owns each CryptoPunks [non-fungible] token. The Ethereum blockchain provides indelible proof. But people disagree about who owns - and who should own - the copyright in the CryptoPunks images. Most CryptoPunks [non-fungible] token owners believe they should own the copyright in the image associated with their [non-fungible] token, or at least have the right to use it. Larva Labs believes it owns the copyright in all of the images, and entered a licensing deal with United Talent Agency based on its ownership of the CryptoPunks brand and copyrights.
>
> Color me skeptical. I'm not sure anyone owns the copyright in the CryptoPunks images, because I'm not sure they're copyrightable in the first place. And I suspect Larva Labs is also worried about the copyrightability of the CryptoPunks images. After all, they complain about copyright infringement, but don't file infringement actions.
>
> In this essay, I explain how copyright works, what it protects, and why. I analyze the copyrightability of the CryptoPunks images. And I reflect on what it means for the CryptoPhunks and V1 Punks [non-fungible] tokens, as well as the [non-fungible] token market in general.

And the paper / essay concludes:

> Does any of this matter? I just explained to you why the CryptoPunks images
> might not be protected by copyright.
> But I'm confident my analysis will have no impact on the market for
> CryptoPunks [non-fungible] tokens. Why not?
> Maybe because copyright doesn't really matter. Or rather, maybe
> because the whole point of [non-fungible] tokens
> is to make copyright irrelevant.
> Larva Labs is obviously
> worried about its copyright in the CryptoPunks images.
> Maybe it should stop worrying and learn to love open-access and the public domain.

What's your take?

The founder of "[**Unauthorized Authentics**](https://unauthedauth.com/)" posts some corrections to the  "Are CryptoPunks Copyrightable?" paper on the finer points of the con-art fraud:

> Neither of these statements is true. Cryptopunks was created before the [ethereum blockchain] metadata standards existed.
> There's no [internet address] URL [in the contract].
> There isn't anything pointing anywhere per se.
>  Similarly there's no actual link between
> the on-chain [cryptopunks] data contract [with the public bitmap pixels and meta data]
> and the cryptopunks contract [V1 or V2].
>
>> Brian L. Frye:
>>  Thx! These are the hard parts to get right.
>>  How would you describe it?
>
>  The gist is the connection between the record of "ownership"
> (the function mapping a token id to an ethereum address)
> and the images is even more tenuous than you suggest.
> Purely socially mediated.
> Nothing in the contract that implies a connection between the two.
>
> As to the on-chain [cryptopunk] data contract, it's basically a [public] server [ / service]
> by another name.
> Again nothing in the cryptopunk contracts that points to them,
> the interface you're using has to know to look it up there.
> The on-chain [cryptopunk] data contract does not conform to any metadata standard either.
>
> But I think there's a key difference between hosting the images on a server, and building them on-chain in a [public] contract (as the data contract does).
> A key feature of ethereum is permissionless composability.
>
> They [the Larva Labs Bros - Matt Hall and John Watkinson -] could have written the contracts to disallow being called by other contracts,
> but they didn't. So my question is: Does that constitute an implied license?
> If not, how does that effect every other type of contract on the network?
> Think it would pose a big issue for defi [decentralized finance services], etc.
>
> [Note: ] The use of the term "encrypted" is not correct,
> if it were encrypted it would need to be decrypted to be read.
> All the data in question is public and unencrypted.
