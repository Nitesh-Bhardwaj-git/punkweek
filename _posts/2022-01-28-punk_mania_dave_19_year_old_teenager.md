title: "Punk Mania - Dave - 19 Year-Old Polish Teenager Pulls In Millions w/ Cinema Punks, Youtuber Punks, Pornstar Punks, & More - Con-Artist Fraudster Or Genius?"
---

  I guess everybody knows the story of the 12-year-old British teenager - [**Benyamin Ahmed aka Obi Wan Benoni**](https://github.com/Weird-Whales/images) -  pulling in a $300 000+ fortune in minutes with faux-pixel punk art - that is, 3350 weird whales [with the help of google - [**for the whale pixel art**](http://pixelartmaker.com/art/43a873c00a73712) - and his programming pro father and [**a South African (crypto) pro coder**](https://etherscan.io/address/0x96ed81c7f4406eff359e27bff6325dc3c9e042bd#code) from [**Boring Bananas Company (BBCo)**](https://www.boringbananas.co)].

  Anyways, while downloading (or is that right-clicking?) and saving punk collections (see [**/collections**](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/collections))  I stumbled over 19-year old Polish teenager Dave¹ - one time, two times, three times and more.

  Dave's "hand-painted one-by-one" punk collections that pull in millions (on OpenSea) include [**youtubepunks**](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/collections/blob/master/youtubepunks/youtubepunks-24x24.png), [**cinemapunks²**](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/collections/blob/master/cinemapunks/cinemapunks-24x24.png) and the latest and greatest and bestselling - SOLD OUT IN 5 MINUTES! -
surprise, surprise  - [**pornstarpunks**](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/collections/blob/master/pornstarpunks/pornstarpunks-32x32.png).
