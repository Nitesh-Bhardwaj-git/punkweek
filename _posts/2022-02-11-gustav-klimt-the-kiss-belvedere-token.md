Inspired by the upcoming million dollar sell-off of .jpgs (or is that [non-fungible] tokens?) of Gustav Klimt's The Kiss by the Austrian Belvedere Gallery - I put together a first (quick & dirty) try of a free (pixel) punk edition (32x32 - see above in 4x zoom).

  Bonus: I added  the Judith (and the Head of Holofernes) artwork / painting for more fun.

  Questions and comments welcome.

PS: Yes, you can. (Re)generate your own golden klimt (pixel) punk artwork in your own home and own 100% forever - see the [**klimt script**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/cryptopunks/blob/master/klimt/klimt.rb) to get started.

About the art:

> Gustav Klimt, The Kiss (Lovers), 1908/09
>
> The couple in The Kiss appear intimately entangled, oblivious to their surroundings
> and lost in their embrace. With this work at the height of his "Golden Period,"
> Austrian painter Gustav Klimt created a universal allegorical statement
> about love as a central theme of human existence.
> The Austrian state bought the work when it was first presented, in 1908,
> for the recently founded Modern Gallery in the Lower Belvedere [in Vienna].
> Since then, the painting has remained in the museum’s holdings.
> Today, The Kiss is considered an icon of Viennese Art Nouveau
> and European Modernism.
> It is one of the most famous and most frequently reproduced works of art in the world.
