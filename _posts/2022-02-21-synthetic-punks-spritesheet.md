As a follow-up to [**Synthetic Punks (On Chain) - Punks For Everyone / Every Ethereum Account / Address by Stephan Cill Et Al - What's Your Take?**](2022-02-21-synthetic-punks.md)  I tried a quick & dirty conversion of the on-chain base64-encoded punk spritesheet (see above in 1x).

  A quick count shows 11 archetypes / faces and 133 attributes (if I am counting right 24 cols x 6 rows - 11 archetypes  = 133 attributes).

<!-- more -->

  Anyways, let's study and learn together. Your questions, comment, insight(s) and tips more than welcome.

**Update**  Ha. I found more details in the synthetic punk sources, see [**synthetic-punks/lib/punks.spritesheet**](https://github.com/stephancill/synthetic-punks/tree/master/lib/punks.spritesheet).  Great to see some punks.spritesheet (re)use!


PS:  Find the "universal" punk (off chain) spritesheet with 100+ archetypes and 800+ attributes so far at [**punks.spritesheet**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/punks.spritesheet).
