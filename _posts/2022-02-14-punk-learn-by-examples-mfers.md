Let's repeat together - the bold claim of the Larva Labs Bros - yes, we are looking at you - Matt & John - trying to claim the anti-corporate greed, anti-consumerist and not "selling out" word "PUNK速" is anything but punk.

  Let's read-up on [**punk (subculture)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_subculture) - let's say on  Wikipedia:

<!-- more -->

> The punk ethos is primarily made up of beliefs such as non-conformity, anti-authoritarianism, anti-corporatism, a do-it-yourself ethic, anti-consumerist, anti-corporate greed, direct action and not "selling out".

Now how does this match-up with the Larva Labs Bros "Public Service Announcements"?

It doesn't mother fuckers. Mother fuckers?! Yes, MOTHER FUCKERS速 - the latest 10 000 profile pic crypto token collectible with a more punk or is that mother fucking attitude.

See [**What are mother fuckers (mfers)?**](https://mirror.xyz/sartoshi.eth/QukjtL1076-1SEoNJuqyc-x4Ut2v8_TocKkszo-S_nU) by Sarthosi, February 2022

What's your take? Is punk dead, mother fuckers?
