As a follow-up to [**Alpha, Alpha, Alpha Alert - 10 000 Dooggies, The World's First 10 000 Doge Edition (Anno 2021) - Free All-In-One Image Composite Download (3200x3200px) - dooggies.png (~1.7MB)**](2022-01-18-10000-dooggies.md)  -
the [non-fungible] token archeologist / collector - Lamborghinis  - who uncovered the dormant 10 000 dooggies collection (Anno 2021) that lay waiting unsold (only about six? dooggies minted) hidden on the public blockchain
before hitting the big time with a new marketing (or is that shilling?) team
and rebranding as world's first historic 10 000 doge collection - posted the image above (titled "Smoking Gun - Bored Ape Yacht Club® Copyright Infringement!?").


   Anyways, the 10 000 dooggies "hand-painted" pixel art in the 32x32 format by a 16-year-old teenager started on April 6th, 2021, that is, two weeks before Bored Ape Yacht Club® (BAYC) -  launched on April 22nd, 2021 -
and ten weeks before Bored Ape Kennel Club® (BAKC) -  launched on June 18th, 2021.

So what?   Lamborghinis points out 20+ surprising match-ups of attributes / traits of the "original" artwork.  The question everyone asking is - who's copying whom?

  You say blockchain and proof-of-provenance?  Well, - surprise, surprise - the pixel art is NOT stored time-stamped "on chain"  and unchangeable forever.
The best there is in  the 2020s so far - is a backup of  pages on the ye' good olde'
Internet Archive thanks to the Wayback Machine - try [**opensea.io/collection/dooggies (2021-04-11)**](https://web.archive.org/web/20210411075500/https://opensea.io/collection/dooggies).   What about the artists?  So far we only hear silence.


What's your take?

Questions and comments welcome.
