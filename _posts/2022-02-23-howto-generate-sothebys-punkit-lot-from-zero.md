As a follow-up to [**Sotheby's Punk It! Truly Historic [Con-Art Fraud] - 104 Matt & John's® Punks V2. 1 Lot. Bid Starting @ US$14 Million - New! All-In-One Right-Click & Save Bitmap - sothebys-punkit.png (~8k) Free Download**](2022-02-22-sothebys-punk-it-free-download.md)  I put together a new script that generates all 104 punks from zero / scratch, that is, using the attributes from the [**punkit.csv dataset**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/cryptopunks/blob/master/sothebys/punkit.csv).

Example - punkit.csv:

    id, type, attribute1, attribute2, attribute3, attribute4
    239, Male 1, Frown, Goat, Mohawk,
    352, Female 2, Straight Hair, Green Eye Shadow,,
    729, Female 4, Straight Hair, Purple Eye Shadow,,
    1054, Male 3, Goat, Earring, Stringy Hair,
    1563, Female 2, Earring, Dark Hair, Clown Eyes Blue,
    1645, Female 1, Purple Lipstick, Earring, Tassle Hat,
    1761, Female 1, Half Shaved, Blue Eye Shadow,,
    1769, Male 1, Mustache, Cap Forward,,
    1804, Female 3, Mole, Messy Hair,,
    2008, Female 1, Earring, Red Mohawk,,
    ...

Note, the ids are "dummies" for reference and NOT used in the generation.

Now the US$ 14+ (or is that 40+?) million dollar question - can you spot the difference (see above in 1x)?

Hint: There's none. The bitmap is a 100% pixel-perfect free digital original.

Questions and comments welcome.

PS: Yes, you can. Generate your own originals that you own 100% forever, see the [**sothebys/generate_punkit script**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/cryptopunks/blob/master/sothebys/generate_punkit.rb) to get started.
